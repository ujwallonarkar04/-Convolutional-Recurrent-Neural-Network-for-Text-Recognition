# -Convolutional-Recurrent-Neural-Network-for-Text-Recognition
Our project uses CRNNs in deep learning to spot and understand text in images. Trained on single-word images, it learns text patterns autonomously. With promising results from the 'MJ Synthetic Word Dataset' (50,000 images), it holds potential for efficient word searches in image collections.
